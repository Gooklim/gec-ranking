This README describes how to reproduce the results in our ACL 2015 paper,

             Ground Truth for Grammatical Error Correction Metrics
       Courtney Napoles, Keisuke Sakaguchi, Joel Tetreault, and Matt Post

The data and code will also be available on github 
(https://github.com/cnap/gec-ranking).

Instructions:

1. Data

The rankings found in the gec-ranking-data correspond to the 12 system outputs
from the CoNLL-14 Shared Task on Grammatical Error Correction, which can be 
downloaded from <http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~nlp/conll14st.html>.

2. Run TrueSkill

To get the human rankings, run TrueSkill (which can be downloaded from
<https://github.com/keisks/wmt-trueskill>) on the human judgments csv file 
(located in gec-ranking/data).

3. Metric scores

   (a) GLEU is included in this directory. To obtain the GLEU scores for system
   output, run the following command:

   ./compute_gleu -s source_sentences -r reference [reference ...] \
		  -o system_output [system_output ...] -n 4 -l 0.0

   where each file contains one sentence per line. GLEU can be run with multiple
   references. To get the GLEU scores of multiple outputs, include the path to 
   each system output file. GLEU was developed using Python 2.7.

   (b) I-measure scores were taken from Felice and Briscoe's 2015 NAACL paper,
   'Towards a standard evaluation method for grammatical error detection and 
   correction'. The I-measure scorer can be downloaded from 
   <https://github.com/mfelice/imeasure>.

   (c) M2 scores were calculated using the official scorer (3.2) of the CoNLL-
   2014 Shared Task <http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~nlp/sw/>).
